    "Sure! Here is a detailed write-up on factor mimicking portfolios, incorporating the specific details you provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factor Mimicking Portfolios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Factor mimicking portfolios are constructed to capture systematic risk factors that explain the returns of a set of assets. These portfolios serve as proxies for theoretical factors in asset pricing models, such as the Fama-French three-factor model, which includes market, size, and value factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Given the loadings matrix \\( B \\) and a set of asset returns \\( R \\), our goal is to estimate the factor returns \\( F \\) and construct the portfolio weights \\( V \\) that mimic these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation Problem\n",
    "The estimation problem can be formulated as a weighted least squares problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\min (R - B F)^\\top W (R - B F) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad F \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( R \\) is the vector of asset returns.\n",
    "- \\( B \\) is the factor loadings matrix.\n",
    "- \\( F \\) is the vector of factor returns to be estimated.\n",
    "- \\( W \\) is a diagonal and positive definite weighting matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighting Matrix\n",
    "The matrix \\( W \\) is typically set to the inverse of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix \\( \\Omega \\). However, since \\( \\Omega \\) is not known in advance, a common practical approach is to use the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "W_{ii} = \\left( \\text{market cap}_i \\right)^{1/2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the market cap of the stock is averaged over a number of days (e.g., 21 trading days).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimated Factor Returns\n",
    "The estimated factor returns \\( \\hat{F} \\) can be obtained using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\hat{F} = (B^\\top W B)^{-1} B^\\top W R\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Residuals\n",
    "The residuals \\( \\hat{\\epsilon} \\) can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\hat{\\epsilon} = (I - B(B^\\top W B)^{-1} B^\\top W) R\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portfolio Weights\n",
    "The matrix \\( V^\\top \\), whose rows represent the portfolio weights for the factor-mimicking portfolios, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "V^\\top = (B^\\top W B)^{-1} B^\\top W\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the matrix \\( V^\\top \\) represents a vector of portfolio weights that correspond to a specific factor. This portfolio has a return \\( \\hat{F} \\) and is called the factor-mimicking portfolio for factor \\( i \\). We denote \\( V \\) as the matrix whose \\( i \\)-th column is the vector \\( v_i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "The matrix \\( V^\\top \\) can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- Each row \\( V_i^\\top \\) represents the weights of a minimum-variance portfolio that has unit exposure to factor \\( i \\) and zero exposure to any other factor.\n",
    "- The estimated factor returns \\( \\hat{F} \\) are the scalar product of the \\( i \\)-th row of the matrix \\( V^\\top \\) and the return vector \\( R \\).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By using the factor loading matrix \\( B \\) and the weighting matrix \\( W \\), we can compute the factor returns \\( \\hat{F} \\) and the portfolio weights \\( V \\) that mimic these factors. These calculations help in understanding the behavior of asset returns and constructing portfolios that are well-diversified against specific risk factors. Factor mimicking portfolios provide a practical tool for risk management and performance attribution in financial markets."
